Aspects of the request affecting the response

Method [5.1.1]

Request-URI [5.1.2]

# general

Cache-Control [14.9]

   ...

Pragma [14.32]

   Pragma: no-cache

   "HTTP/1.1 caches SHOULD treat "Pragma: no-cache" as if the client
   had sent "Cache-Control: no-cache". No new Pragma directives will
   be defined in HTTP."

Connection [14.10]

   Connection: close

   "HTTP/1.1 defines the "close" connection option for the sender to
   signal that the connection will be closed after completion of the
   response."

Date [14.18]

   Date: Tue, 15 Nov 1994 08:12:31 GMT

   "represents the date and time at which the message was originated
   ...  clients SHOULD only send a Date header field in messages that
   include an entity-body, as in the case of the PUT and POST
   requests, and even then ..."

Trailer [14.40]

   Trailer: field, field, ...

   "An HTTP/1.1 message SHOULD include a Trailer header field in a
   message using chunked transfer-coding with a non-empty
   trailer. Doing so allows the recipient to know which header fields
   to expect in the trailer.  If no Trailer header field is present,
   the trailer SHOULD NOT include any header fields."

Transfer-Encoding [14.41]

   chunked, identity, gzip, compress, deflate

   "... indicates what (if any) type of transformation has been
   applied to the message body in order to safely transfer it between
   the sender and the recipient. This differs from the content-coding
   in that the transfer-coding is a property of the message, not of
   the entity."

Upgrade [14.42]

   "... intended to provide a simple mechanism for transition from
   HTTP/1.1 to some other, incompatible protocol. It does so by
   allowing the client to advertise its desire to use another protocol
   [---] only applies to switching application-layer protocols upon
   the existing transport-layer connection. Upgrade cannot be used to
   insist on a protocol change; its acceptance and use by the server
   is optional."

Via [14.45]

   "... MUST be used by gateways and proxies to indicate the
   intermediate protocols and recipients between the user agent and
   the server on requests, and between the origin server and the
   client on responses."

Warning [14.46]

   ...

# request

Accept [14.1]

   "... specify certain media types which are acceptable for the
   response."

Accept-Charset [14.2]

   "... indicate what character sets are acceptable for the
   response. If no Accept-Charset header is present, the default is
   that any character set is acceptable."

Accept-Encoding [14.3]

   identity, gzip, compress, deflate

   "... restricts the content-codings (section 3.5) that are
   acceptable in the response. If the Accept-Encoding field-value is
   empty, then only the "identity" encoding is acceptable. If no
   Accept-Encoding field is present in a request, the server MAY
   assume that the client will accept any content coding. In this
   case, if "identity" is one of the available content-codings, then
   the server SHOULD use the "identity" content-coding"

Accept-Language [14.4]

   "... restricts the set of natural languages that are preferred as a
   response to the request."

Authorization [14.8]

   "A user agent that wishes to authenticate itself with a server
   ... does so by including an Authorization request-header field with
   the request.  The Authorization field value consists of credentials
   containing the authentication information of the user agent for the
   realm of the resource being requested."

Expect [14.20]

   Expect: 100-continue

   "The purpose of the 100 (Continue) status (see section 10.1.1) is to
   allow a client that is sending a request message with a request body
   to determine if the origin server is willing to accept the request
   (based on the request headers) before the client sends the request
   body. In some cases, it might either be inappropriate or highly
   inefficient for the client to send the body if the server will reject
   the message without looking at the body."

From [14.22]

   "an Internet e-mail address for the human user who controls the
   requesting user agent"

Host [14.23]

   "... Internet host and port number of the resource being requested,
   as obtained from the original URI given by the user or referring
   resource. [---] All Internet-based HTTP/1.1 servers MUST respond
   with a 400 (Bad Request) status code to any HTTP/1.1 request
   message which lacks a Host header field."

If-Match [14.24]

   If-Match: etag, etag, ...
   If-Match: *

   "A client that has one or more entities previously
   obtained from the resource can verify that one of those entities is
   current by including a list of their associated entity tags in the
   If-Match header field.

   If none of the entity tags match, or if "*" is given and no current
   entity exists, the server MUST NOT perform the requested method, and
   MUST return a 412 (Precondition Failed) response. This behavior is
   most useful when ...

   If the request would, without the If-Match header field, result in
   anything other than a 2xx or 412 status, then the If-Match header
   MUST be ignored.

   The result of a request having both an If-Match header field and
   either an If-None-Match or an If-Modified-Since header fields is
   undefined by this specification."

If-Modified-Since [14.25]

   If-Modified-Since: Sat, 29 Oct 1994 19:43:31 GMT

   "... instead, a 304 (not modified) response will
   be returned without any message-body."

If-None-Match [14.26]

   If-None-Match: etag, etag, ...
   If-None-Match: *

   "If any of the entity tags match the entity tag of the entity that
   would have been returned in the response to a similar GET request
   ... on that resource, or if "*" is given and any current entity
   exists for that resource, then the server MUST NOT perform the
   requested method, unless required to do so because the resource's
   modification date fails to match that supplied in an
   If-Modified-Since header field in the request.

   Instead, if the request method was GET or HEAD, the server SHOULD
   respond with a 304 (Not Modified) response, including the cache-
   related header fields (particularly ETag) of one of the entities
   that matched. For all other request methods, the server MUST
   respond with a status of 412 (Precondition Failed)."

If-Range [14.27]

   If-Range: etag
   If-Range: Sat, 29 Oct 1994 19:43:31 GMT

   "if the entity is unchanged, send me the part(s) that I am missing;
   otherwise, send me the entire new entity"

If-Unmodified-Since [14.28]

   If-Unmodified-Since: Sat, 29 Oct 1994 19:43:31 GMT

Max-Forwards [14.31]

   ...

Proxy-Authenticate [14.33]

   ...

Range [14.35]

   "HTTP retrieval requests using conditional or unconditional GET
   methods MAY request one or more sub-ranges of the entity, instead
   of the entire entity, using the Range request header, which applies
   to the entity returned as the result of the request. ... the
   response carries a status code of 206 (Partial Content) instead of
   200 (OK)."

Referer [14.36]

   ...

TE [14.39]

   "The TE request-header field indicates what extension
   transfer-codings it is willing to accept in the response and
   whether or not it is willing to accept trailer fields in a chunked
   transfer-coding. Its value may consist of the keyword "trailers"
   and/or a comma-separated list of extension transfer-coding names
   with optional accept parameters (as described in section 3.6).

   ...  The TE header field only applies to the immediate connection.
   Therefore, the keyword MUST be supplied within a Connection header
   field (section 14.10) whenever TE is present in an HTTP/1.1
   message.  ... The "chunked" transfer-coding is always acceptable."

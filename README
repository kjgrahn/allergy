ALLERGY

'Allergy' (many thanks to http://www.wordsmith.org/anagram/ for the name)
is yet another utility to generate a 'photo album' or 'image gallery' for
presenting an overview of lots of images in a web browser.

Generating and updating thumbnails and the supporting HTML by hand is
time consuming, error-prone and boring.

Yes, I *did* do a search on http://freshmeat.net first. However, most
gallery programs were PHP applications (apparently dynamic pages have
a higher macho factor than static ones) or were too complex[1].
I just wanted the job done, so I did it myself.


INSTALLATION AND REQUIREMENTS

Allergy is just a medium-sized Perl script and a manpage.
Install it by hand or do

# make install

The generated HTML text will render well only in the presence of a
suitable style sheet; `examples/darkroom.css' is included, but you
will have to install or copy (and customize!) it manually.

As far as I know, allergy doesn't depend on any particularly new
Perl feature. What it *does* depend on is a set of image
manipulation tools collectively known as "netpbm". Since these
don't cover the JPEG format[0], you also need 'djpeg' and 'djpeg', which
come bundled in one way or another with 'libjpeg'.


LICENSE

I'm too bored by this subject right now to give it much thought, so let it
be known: 'allergy' is available under a BSD-style license, without the
non-advertising clause.

[0] Or I thought they didn't. ppmtojpeg and jpegtopnm seem to be there
    in current versions.
[1] Photoaddict <URL:http://photoaddict.sourceforge.net/> looks kind of
    promising, but I found out about it too late.
    'cthumb' and 'webmagick' seem to be alternatives too.

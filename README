ALLERGY

'Allergy' (many thanks to http://www.wordsmith.org/anagram/ for the name)
is yet another utility to generate a 'photo album' or 'image gallery' for
presenting an overview of lots of images in a web browser.

Generating and updating thumbnails and the supporting HTML by hand is
time consuming, error-prone and boring.

Yes, I *did* do a search on http://freshmeat.net first. However, most
gallery programs were PHP applications (apparently dynamic pages have
a higher macho factor than static ones) or were too complex[1].
I just wanted the job done, so I did it myself.


INSTALLATION AND REQUIREMENTS

Allergy is just a Python script and a manpage.
Install it by hand or do

# make install

Allergy requires Python and the Python Imaging Library (PIL).
I believe it is portable to any platform which can support Python and
PIL, but I only have access to Linux syetems myself.

The generated HTML text will render well only in the presence of a
suitable style sheet; `examples/darkroom.css' is included, but you
will have to install or copy (and customize!) it manually.


LICENSE

I'm too bored by this subject right now to give it much thought, so let it
be known: 'allergy' is available under a BSD-style license, without the
non-advertising clause.

    promising, but I found out about it too late.
    'cthumb' and 'webmagick' seem to be alternatives too.

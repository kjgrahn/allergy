ALLERGY

'Allergy' (many thanks to http://www.wordsmith.org/anagram/ for the name)
is yet another utility to generate a 'photo album' or 'image gallery' for
presenting an overview of lots of images in a web browser.

Generating and updating thumbnails and the supporting HTML by hand is
time consuming, error-prone and boring.

Yes, I *did* do a search on http://freshmeat.net first. However, most
gallery programs were PHP applications (apparently dynamic pages have
a higher macho factor than static ones) or were too complex[1].
I just wanted the job done, so I did it myself.


INSTALLATION AND REQUIREMENTS

Allergy is just a Python script and a manpage.
Install it by hand or do

# make install

Allergy requires Python and the Python Imaging Library (PIL).
I believe it is portable to any platform which can support Python and
PIL, but I only have access to Linux syetems myself.

Additionally, if Gene Cash's 'EXIF' python module[2] is installed, it
may be used to pull creation date and time from images that happen to
contain them.

The generated HTML text will render well only in the presence of a
suitable style sheet; `examples/darkroom.css' is included, but you
will have to install or copy (and customize!) it manually.

[1] Photoaddict <URL:http://photoaddict.sourceforge.net/> looks kind of
    promising, but I found out about it too late.
    'cthumb' and 'webmagick' seem to be alternatives too.

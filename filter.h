/**
 * Response writing filters.
 *
 * These are chainable, because you must be able to write:
 * (a) headers
 * (b) data (entity-body) as-is
 * (c) compressed data
 * (d) chunked data
 * (e) compressed and chunked data
 *
 * The thing is, what's at the bottom is a nonblocking socket
 * which may only partially accept a write(), but we need something
 * inbetween which will buffer the remainder *and* at the same time
 * signal the original writer to back off until the socket becomes
 * writable again.
 *
 * Writing through a filter means a series of write(fd, data) calls
 * followed by one or more end(fd) calls.  The latter is used when the
 * actual data has run out, and serves to (a) write any EOF markers
 * mandated by the filter or underlying filters, such as the zero
 * chunk length of a Chunked encoding, and (b) to flush the buffered
 * data to the fd.
 *
 * Both write(fd, data) and end(fd) have the semantics:
 * true:  All data was successfully written to the fd, the backlog
 *        is empty, and you may continue writing.
 * false: Some data was /not/ written successfully, and was stored
 *        in the backlog. You may not write again (or count the
 *        response as complete, in the end() case) unless the fd
 *        goes writable.
 * All other situations map to an exception being thrown.

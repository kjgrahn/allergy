- Implement non-blocking accept() and close() if needed.

- Fairness. Don't let one session starve the others.  Favor writing

- Can we deadlock a Session by writing and not immediately read()
  when there's something to read?

- Should Sessions to the same endpoint be punished? Rewarded? Should
  we care? We cannot reliably detect the same session.

- How to balance accept() vs servicing existing Sessions?

- Exceptions in the Response handling; architecture.

 * A HTTP session, or more generally a pipelined request-response TCP
 * session using nonblocking I/O.
 *
 * The logical view is two possibly infinite sequences of requests and
 * responses. A read may give use 0--N complete requests. A write may
 * complete a response.

 *     | req               | resp

 *
 * At any moment there's a queue of 0--N complete Requests, the oldest of
 * which is associated with a Response, the goal of which is to empty
 * itself into the fd.
 *
 * The interface is simply three functions:
 * - the fd is readable
 * - the fd is writable
 * - have you had no success lately?

 * - blocked WRITING: I need to write, but the write would block.
 *   Notify me when the fd is writable again.
 * - DEAD: the NNTP session has died (either controlledly or by
 *   I/O error); the fd and this Session are both useless.

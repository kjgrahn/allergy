Major changes (with focus on user-visible changes) to allergy, per version.

_________________________________________

allergy 1.3 (2001-10-04):
	- Added the 'list' style as a table-free alternative to
	  the 'grid' style; more useful for pictures with caption
	  text.
	- HTML bug fix; an unneccesary and illegal comma used to
	  be generated within the rendered <img>.
	- Continuation lines made part of the syntax, so that you can
	  divide a long caption text over several lines in the input.

allergy 1.2 (2001-08-29):
	- Comments (classic '#'-style) are now part of the syntax.
	- Partial support for caption text.
	- JPEG quality of the thumbnails is controllable rather than
	  fixed to '30'.
	- Support for IFF-ILBM images.

allergy 1.1 (2001-07-29):
	- Lots of bug fixes.

allergy 1.0 (2001-07-28):
	- First public version.

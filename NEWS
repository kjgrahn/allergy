Major changes (with focus on user-visible changes) to allergy, per version.

_________________________________________

	- allergy: by default, make the images' caption texts normal
	  HTML text, not a popup-style title attribute.

allergy 5.7 (2010-07-20):
	- allergy_index: don't sort "photos from yyyy-mm-dd" lists
	  newest first -- it's only natural for pages which can
	  potentially be very long, like the full list and the by-key
	  pages.

allergy 5.6 (2010-05-14):
	- allergy-mode.el bug fix; colorize years after 2010 properly.

allergy 5.5 (2009-05-03):
	- Bug fix. 5.4 broke allergy_index slightly.

allergy 5.4 (2009-05-03):
	- Thumbnail images are now collected under subdirectories
          'thumb' to get them out of the way.  For example,
          'foo/bar.png' is thumbnailed into 'foo/thumb/bar.jpg'.

allergy 5.3 (2009-05-03):
	- allergy_index: generate indices for individual dates, e.g.
	  /2009-05-03. Also link back from all tables to the by-year,
	  by-month and by-day indices. This is useful for navigating
	  from a "keyworded" photo to the list of photos taken that
	  day, and so on.

allergy 5.2 (2009-03-18):
	- allergy: do not require photo description files to contain
	  dates. If you scan e.g. old photo collections, you sometimes
	  cannot tell which /decade/ each picture is from.

        - Includes allergy-mode, a Gnu Emacs mode for editing photo
          description files.

allergy 5.1 (2008-10-28):
	- allergy_index: include image thumbnail galleries for the
	  smaller pages (by month and by keyword) so you can see all
	  photos of a certain thing or kind gathered on one page.

allergy 5.0 (2008-10-20):
	- allergy_index - serve photo gallery indices over HTTP.
	  This is a simple web server which generates by-date and
	  by-keyword indices of photos, based on the photos and a text
	  file describing them. It does not serve the actual /images/.

	  What I like to do is to generate static galleries using
	  allergy(1), and run this one on the side, for a different view.
	  Like when you want to find all photos from a certain place
	  or a certain month, or something.

allergy 4.0 (2008-07-18):
	- Exactly three years later.
	- Split the -f file parser into Python module 'photobase', and
	  extended the file format to contain two kinds of key phrases
	  ("tags" in current lingo), useful for building indicies of
	  photos per topic.

allergy 3.1 (2005-07-18):
	- Fixed a silly bug in the -f file parser; crash if the
	  file didn't end in an empty line.

allergy 3.0 (2005-07-08):
	- New option -f for picking image descriptions from
	  a separate file so you don't have to enter these as caption
	  texts. This is useful if you already keep track of images
	  from your digital camera, or whatever.

	- Can now pick and display the time a photo was taken based on
	  the EXIF information in the image file, if available.

allergy 2.3 (2005-03-28):
	- Bug fix: Never generate empty tables when there are no
	  images to show (e.g. theres a *.jpg gallery definition, but
	  no files matching that pattern.)  Generating them meant
	  generating invalid HTML (which browsers probably show
	  correctly, but you never know).

allergy 2.2 (2005-02-20):
	- Bug fix: the -k flag broke when a thumbnail we expected to
	  exist didn't.  Of course, it should have been generated in
	  this case.

allergy 2.1 (2004-06-20):
	- Bug fix: thumbnailing palette-based images now works.
	- Now defaults to silent mode rather than printing the name
	  of each image; that now requires the -v command-line option.
	- New option -V for printing a '.' for each image.
        - Input from multiple files, or from standard input,
	  works again as advertised.

allergy 2.0 (2004-06-16):
	- Rewritten in Python using the Python Imaging Library.
	- Runs much (several times?) faster than previous versions.
	  This was the primary reason for the rewrite.
	- Supports placing caption text in the "title" attribute.
	- A handful of incompatibilities against 1.4; see the man
	  page for details.

allergy 1.4 (2001-12-06):
	- Added an option (-k) to keep existing thumbnails from
	  being overwritten, even if they appear to be obsolete.

allergy 1.3 (2001-10-04):
	- Added the 'list' style as a table-free alternative to
	  the 'grid' style; more useful for pictures with caption
	  text.
	- HTML bug fix; an unneccesary and illegal comma used to
	  be generated within the rendered <img>.
	- Continuation lines made part of the syntax, so that you can
	  divide a long caption text over several lines in the input.

allergy 1.2 (2001-08-29):
	- Comments (classic '#'-style) are now part of the syntax.
	- Partial support for caption text.
	- JPEG quality of the thumbnails is controllable rather than
	  fixed to '30'.
	- Support for IFF-ILBM images.

allergy 1.1 (2001-07-29):
	- Lots of bug fixes.

allergy 1.0 (2001-07-28):
	- First public version.

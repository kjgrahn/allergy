Major changes (with focus on user-visible changes) to allergy, per version.

_________________________________________

allergy 2.1 (2004-06-20):
	- Bug fix: thumbnailing palette-based images now works.
	- Now defaults to silent mode rather than printing the name
	  of each image; that now requires the -v command-line option.
	- New option -V for printing a '.' for each image.
        - Input from multiple files, or from standard input,
	  works again as advertised.

allergy 2.0 (2004-06-16):
	- Rewritten in Python using the Python Imaging Library.
	- Runs much (several times?) faster than previous versions.
	  This was the primary reason for the rewrite.
	- Supports placing caption text in the "title" attribute.
	- A handful of incompatibilities against 1.4; see the man
	  page for details.

allergy 1.4 (2001-12-06):
	- Added an option (-k) to keep existing thumbnails from
	  being overwritten, even if they appear to be obsolete.

allergy 1.3 (2001-10-04):
	- Added the 'list' style as a table-free alternative to
	  the 'grid' style; more useful for pictures with caption
	  text.
	- HTML bug fix; an unneccesary and illegal comma used to
	  be generated within the rendered <img>.
	- Continuation lines made part of the syntax, so that you can
	  divide a long caption text over several lines in the input.

allergy 1.2 (2001-08-29):
	- Comments (classic '#'-style) are now part of the syntax.
	- Partial support for caption text.
	- JPEG quality of the thumbnails is controllable rather than
	  fixed to '30'.
	- Support for IFF-ILBM images.

allergy 1.1 (2001-07-29):
	- Lots of bug fixes.

allergy 1.0 (2001-07-28):
	- First public version.

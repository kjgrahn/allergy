.SH "DATA MODEL"
Put differently, mapping between HTTP and the file system.
What a GET request for a certain URL means, given what exists
in the corresponding file system.
.
.BP foo/
.I foo/index.html
exists, and is the resource.
.
.BP foo/
.I foo
is a directory, and an HTML version of
.I "ls -l foo"
is the resource.
.\" What about thumbnailing pictures?
.\" What about generating text/plain instead?
.\" What about different file name encodings?
.
.BP foo
.I foo
is a directory, and a redirect to foo/ is generated.
.\" Why? It's how Apache does it, but there should be a reason.
.
.BP foo*
No file named
.I foo*
exists, but applying file globbing shows
.I foobar
as the single match, and a redirect is generated.
.
.BP foo*
Applying file globbing shows multiple matches, and the resource
is an
.IR ls -like
HTML listing of them.
.
.BP foo.jpg
The file does not exist, but
.I foo.png
does, and converted to jpeg format it becomes the resource.
.
.BP image/orig
.I image
exists and is an image. It becomes the resource.
.
.BP image/small
.IR image ,
scaled down to some reasonable size (roughly: fitting in a typical browser
window) and converted to jpeg format, becomes the resource.
.
.BP image/thumb
Like
.BR image/small ,
but scaled even smaller.
.
.BP image/lq
Like
.BR image/small ,
but not scaled, just converted to low-quality jpeg \(en
smallish, but good enough for photos intended for casual viewing.
